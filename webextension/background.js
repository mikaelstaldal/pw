// --- HTTP authentication (opt-in) ------------------------------------------
//
// Firefox's HTTP-auth prompt is browser chrome, not DOM, so it cannot be
// filled. Instead, with the optional permissions in `auth-permissions.js`
// granted, the 401 is answered before the prompt is shown and the prompt never
// appears. Declining to answer (returning `{}`) always falls back to it.
//
// Unlike the form fill, this has no user gesture behind it, so it is
// deliberately narrow: top-level document loads only (never a subresource or
// an iframe, so an embedded `<img>`/`<iframe>` cannot make the browser submit
// your credentials somewhere in the background), never a proxy challenge,
// never off a locked vault on its own — a page must not be able to summon a
// pinentry dialog — and only for an entry whose site is *exactly* the
// challenging host, so a subdomain someone else controls cannot silently
// collect the parent domain's password.
//
// When several entries match that host — separate realms under one domain,
// each with its own username — the challenge is held while the popup asks
// which one to use. Nothing is released until the user picks; closing the
// popup, or waiting too long, hands the challenge back to Firefox's dialog.
//
// The same hold answers a locked vault: instead of declining outright, the
// challenge waits while the popup offers to unlock. That keeps the rule the
// host enforces — a page load cannot summon a pinentry dialog — because what
// the page summons is the popup, which releases nothing; pinentry still takes
// a click. What it does cost is that the offer has to come before we can know
// whether we even have an entry for the site, since finding out requires the
// vault to be open. Any https site that returns 401 can therefore put the
// offer up, so a host whose offer went unanswered is not asked about again for
// `UNLOCK_OFFER_RETRY_MS`.

// means the credentials were refused, and the user gets the native dialog.
