# pw Firefox extension

The browser half of the pw Firefox integration. It holds no secrets and
contains no crypto: it asks the native host
`pw-browser-host` for the single login matching the active tab and fills it
into the page. The master passphrase is entered in a `pinentry` dialog outside
the browser, and only the matching entry is ever sent to the extension.

## Install the native host first

```sh
pw install-browser
```

This writes the native-messaging manifest (`nu.staldal.pw.json`) pointing at
`pw-browser-host`, and a default `~/.config/pw/browser.json`. The manifest's
`allowed_extensions` pins `pw@staldal.nu`, so only this extension can talk to
the host.

## Load the extension

**Development (one browser session):**

1. Open `about:debugging` → *This Firefox* → *Load Temporary Add-on…*
2. Select `manifest.json` in this directory.

Or with [`web-ext`](https://extensionworkshop.com/documentation/develop/web-ext-command-reference/):

```sh
web-ext run -s webextension
```

**Permanent:** Firefox only installs signed extensions. Submit the packaged
`.xpi` to addons.mozilla.org as an *unlisted* add-on; AMO signs it, and the
signed file can be installed from the GitHub releases page.

## Use

On a login page, click the toolbar button or press `Ctrl+Alt+L` (remappable in
`about:addons` → gear → *Manage Extension Shortcuts*). There is also a
*"Fill login with pw"* context-menu item.

The popup also has an **Unlock** button (it becomes **Lock** once the vault is
open). Unlocking there prompts for the master passphrase in `pinentry` without
filling anything and without releasing any entry, so the first fill of the
session does not have to be the thing that opens the vault. Lock discards the
host's decrypted copy immediately.

The host fills an entry only on a site that matches the entry's `url` — set only
from the CLI (never from the browser), which is what keeps the host read-only.
Only entries with a `url` are eligible; set the site with
`pw add <name> --url …` / `pw update <name> --url …` (the entry `name` is never
matched against the site). `--realm …` narrows an entry to one HTTP
authentication realm on that site; see below. Fills then happen with no prompt
until the host's cache expires (`cache_minutes`, default 10).

## HTTP authentication (off by default)

Firefox's HTTP authentication prompt is browser chrome, not part of the page,
so no extension can type into it. What the extension can do instead is answer
the `401` before the prompt is shown, so it never appears.

That requires seeing requests to every site (`webRequest`, `webRequestBlocking`
and host permissions), which the extension does not ask for at install time.
Turn it on in `about:addons` → *pw* → *Preferences* (or the *Settings* link in
the popup) and Firefox asks you to grant them; the same page turns it back off,
as does *Permissions* in `about:addons`.

With it on, a challenge is answered only when **all** of these hold — otherwise
the normal dialog appears, exactly as it does today:

- it is a top-level page load, not an image, script, stylesheet or iframe, so
  an embedded resource cannot make Firefox submit your credentials in the
  background;
- the site is `https:` (or `http://localhost` / `http://127.0.0.1`), and it is
  a site challenge, not a proxy challenge;
- an entry's `url` names *exactly* that host. Unlike a form fill, a parent
  domain does not match: an entry for `example.com` is not released to
  `evil.example.com`, which a form fill would fill if you clicked to. Nothing
  here is a click, so a subdomain someone else controls must not be able to
  collect the parent domain's password silently;
- the entry's `realm`, if it has one, is the realm being challenged for. Set it
  with `pw add <name> --url … --realm …` when a host runs more than one
  protection space. An entry naming the challenged realm wins outright; failing
  that, entries naming no realm are used (an untagged entry is a wildcard over
  its host, which every entry written before the field existed is); an entry
  naming a different realm is never released. Realms are compared as exact
  strings. A form fill ignores the realm — a login form belongs to no
  protection space;
- the vault is unlocked, or you take up the offer to unlock described below.
  The request used here, `get-logins-strict`, is answered with `locked` rather
  than a passphrase prompt, so a page load cannot summon a `pinentry` dialog by
  itself;
- at least one entry matches. If several still do after the realm has been
  applied — two untagged entries on one host, say — the popup opens and asks
  which one, naming the challenging host and realm; the page load waits, and
  nothing is released until you pick. Closing the popup, or leaving it for a
  minute, gives the challenge back to the dialog. Only the active tab is asked
  about, since that is the tab the popup belongs to; a challenge in a
  background tab gets the dialog.

Credentials that the server rejects are not retried: the second challenge for
the same request falls through to the dialog, chooser or not.

### Offering to unlock from a challenge

Unlocking *before* navigating would be the awkward part of the above, so a
challenge that finds the vault locked is held while the popup offers to unlock,
instead of being handed straight to Firefox's dialog. Clicking *Unlock and sign
in* raises `pinentry`; the challenge waits, and is answered when it returns (or
falls through to the dialog if you cancel, or leave the prompt standing for
three minutes).

The rule the host enforces is unchanged: a page load cannot summon a `pinentry`
dialog. What a page can summon is the popup, which releases nothing. The click
sends `get-logins-strict-unlock` — the same exact-host matching, but permitted
to prompt — which does the unlocking and the matching in a single request, so
nothing can relock in between (with `cache_minutes: 0` something always would).
If several entries then match, the realm chooser follows in a newly opened
popup, since `pinentry` taking focus closes the one that started it. The
popup's own **Unlock** button takes the same path while a challenge is waiting,
rather than unlocking a vault the challenge has already given up on.

Because pw cannot tell whether it has an entry for a site until the vault is
open, the offer has to come before that is known: any `https:` site returning
`401` can put it up. A host whose offer goes unanswered is left alone for five
minutes; that memory is in the background script only and is never written to
disk.

When pw does answer, the toolbar button shows a green ✓ for three seconds once
the page has loaded — the only sign that it happened, since no dialog appears.
(The badge has to wait for the load: a tab's badge is cleared when the tab
navigates, and answering the challenge is part of that navigation.)

## Troubleshooting

Firefox discards the host's stderr, so to diagnose a fill that does nothing,
enable the host's debug log. Add a `log_file` to `~/.config/pw/browser.json`:

```json
{ "log_file": "~/pw-host.log" }
```

(or set `PW_BROWSER_LOG=/path/to/log`, which overrides it). The host then
appends, per request, its version, the environment it was launched with
(`DISPLAY`, `WAYLAND_DISPLAY`, `DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS`, …), the full
pinentry exchange, and the outcome. The passphrase is never written — the
pinentry data line is reduced to its byte length. Remove `log_file` when done.

This is the place to look when a fill hangs: it shows whether the host reached
`pinentry`, what environment `pinentry` was given, and whether it returned a
passphrase or stalled.

## Limitations (phase 1)

- Top-level frame only; login forms inside cross-origin iframes are not filled.
- No form detection/highlighting, no save-on-submit, no password generation.
- Fields in closed shadow DOM are not reachable.
- HTTP authentication is answered only on a top-level load in the active tab
  (see above). The realm is matched only against one an entry names itself;
  there is no way to have the browser record it for you when you sign in.
